# PyBer Analysis
**Performing Analysis on Ride-Sharing Data**

  ## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project is to carry out analysis on ride-sharing data for three different city types, namely: rural, urban and sub-urban. The ride sharing data will be analysed and summarised using the Python Pandas library and a multi-line graph to visualise the result of the analysis will be created using Matplotlib.

  ## Results
  The summary dataframe below will be used to explain the results for the first set of analysis:

   + Total Rides for Each City Type - The total number of rides in the Rural city type is 5 times less than that of the Suburban city type and 13 times less than the number of rides in the Urban city type.

   + Total Drivers for Each City Type - There are 2405 drivers in the Urban city type which is 4 and 6 times the total drivers in the Suburban and Rural city types respectively.

   + Total Amount of Fares for Each City Type - As expected, due to the high number of rides and drivers in the Urban city type, the Urban city type generated the highest total fares, an amount of $39854.38.

   + Average Fare per Ride for Each City Type - The average fare per ride to the nearest tenth were comparatively the same for Urban and Suburban city types, a difference of approximately $4 more for the Urban city type while the Rural city type was slightly below by the Urban city type by $10.

   + Average Fare per driver for Each City Type - The average fare per driver for the Urban city type was $19 more than that of the Suburban city type and $39 more than that of the Rural City type.

   
   The mutli-line graph below will be used to explain the result for the final analysis:

   + Total Fare By City Type - The total weekly fare for each city types between the months of January and April, 2019 is presented in the graph above. The Urban city type generated the highest fare for each month, with high values for all cities seen in the month of February. The Urban city generated it's least total fare in the month of January, similarly the Rural city type also generated it's least total fare in the month of January and same trend is also observed for the Suburban city type with it's least total fare in the month of January. Peak total fare was recorded for the Rural city type in the month of April.

   

   ## Summary
   
   Based on the above analysis, the following recommendations are suggested to improve performance and profitability:
